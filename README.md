# Project

Building constructive habits is a challenge that many of us struggle with. Making sure we wake up when we should, making sure we don’t get distracted studying, 
and making sure we go to bed on time are all good things but hard to do consistently. Enter our app, Commit. Commit will help users to create effective habits through accountability. 
To help your community keep you accountable, we will have a friend system that can see when you don’t follow through on your goals. 
By using alarms that alert friends if the task is left incomplete, we are able to create a community that will keep the user accountable, and through this, help build better habits.

Similar apps to this include Forest and BeReal. Forest is an app that has a stopwatch function that helps you grow taller trees the longer you stay on the app and don't exit to another. 
We will also have study timers, but ours will be set to alert your community when you fail to meet your study goal. 
This way, you are motivated to stay away from distractions, so no one will call you out. BeReal has a dashboard that enables friends to react with pictures and comments, 
but ours will allow these reactions to all the actions the user has taken recently. Also, our dashboard will include a graph showing how faithful to your goals
you were compared to your friends and your previous days. With this, we are able to help users stay productive with the power of accountability!
