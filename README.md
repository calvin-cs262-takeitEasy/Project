Creating constructive habits is a challenge that many of us struggle with. Making sure we wake up when we should, making sure we don’t get distracted studying, and making sure we go to bed on time are all good things but hard to do consistently. 
Enter OUR APP. OUR APP will help users to create effective habits through accountability. To help your community keep you accountable, we will have a friend system. 
By using alarms that alert friends if the task is left incomplete, we are able to create a community that will keep the user accountable, and shame them if they are too irresponsible. 

Similar apps to this include Forest, an app that has a stopwatch function that helps you grow taller trees the longer you stay on the app and don't exit to another. 
We will also have study timers, but ours will be set to alert your community when you fail to meet your study goal. This way, you are motivated to stay away from distractions so no one will call you out. 
We hope to have a dashboard similar to BeReal in that it will enable friends to react with pictures and comments to all the actions the user has taken recently. 
With Shame Graphs showing how your day compares to your friends and your previous days, we are able to help users stay productive with the power of shame!
